+     * This fixes a validation issue with the Collection. Suppose
+     * the following situation:
+     *
+     * A) Edit a Genus
+     * B) Add 2 new scientists - don't submit & leave all fields blank
+     * C) Delete the FIRST scientist
+     * D) Submit the form
+     *
+     * The one new scientist has a validation error, because
+     * the yearsStudied field was left blank. But, this error
+     * shows at the *top* of the form, not attached to the form.
+     * The reason is that, on submit, addGenusScientist() is
+     * called, and the new scientist is added to the next available
+     * index (so, if the Genus previously had 2 scientists, the
+     * new GenusScientist is added to the "2" index). However,
+     * in the HTML before the form was submitted, the index used
+     * in the name attribute of the fields for the new scientist
+     * was *3*: 0 & 1 were used for the existing scientists and 2 was
+     * used for the first genus scientist form that you added
+     * (and then later deleted). This mis-match confuses the validator,
+     * which thinks there is an error on genusScientists[2].yearsStudied,
+     * and fails to map that to the genusScientists[3].yearsStudied
+     * field.
+     *
+     * Phew! It's a big pain :). Below, we fix it! On submit,
+     * we simply re-index the submitted data before it's bound
+     * to the form. The submitted genusScientists data, which
+     * previously had index 0, 1 and 3, will now have indexes
+     * 0, 1 and 2. And these indexes will match the indexes
+     * that they have on the Genus.genusScientists property.
